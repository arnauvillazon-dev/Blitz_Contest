A Competitive Game Environment for AI Research and Mechanic Analysis.

This repository hosts a game environment primarily developed to support research into heuristic decision-making and evolutionary computing, utilising genetic algorithms to train agents for strategic gameplay.

Note on Origin and Goal: The game code itself was developed externally (i.e., not by the primary project investigators) and serves as a virtualisation tool. The fundamental goal of this project is not the coding of the game, but the investigation and analysis of its mechanics. Specifically, the project seeks to answer questions related to:
- Optimal strategic moves and learning phases.
- The feasibility of developing an ELO rating system.
- The learning curve and complexity of game mechanics.
